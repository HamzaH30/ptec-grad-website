        Welcome to the repository for our graduating class website! This website
        is dedicated to showcasing the accomplishments, experiences, and
        projects of our dual-credit program in Software Development and

      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p>
        We are a diverse group of students enrolled in a dual-credit program
        that focuses on two main disciplines:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Software Development</li>
        <p>
          Students in this track are currently pursuing a Software Development
          Diploma. We are learning various programming languages, software
          engineering principles, and practical application development.
        </p>
        <li>Networking and Cloud Administration</li>
        <p>
          The other half of our class is dedicated to the Networking and Cloud
          Administration program. We cover subjects such as Cisco, CCNA, and
          other essential networking and cloud technologies.
        </p>
      </ol>
